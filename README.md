Oh hi, you're not supposed to be here.

LInk to portfolio: https://dann-lam.github.io/portfolio-v3/
Current bugs and to do list:

While the media queries are functional, they're not fantastic. In the future it'd be nice to have them scale properly for nearly all resolutions, bootstrap would be a good solution for this.

mobile resolutions, ipad and 720p up to 2k is supported. 4k is possible, but because of the nature of the parallax elements, would have to be adjusted specifically for larger resolutions.

When you click on the contact link from the navbar while at the bottom of contact, it seems to spawn a black bar at the bottom.

Update the resume.

CSS file is fairly messy, albeit everything serves a function, there is tons of repetition, it could be much DRYer and much more efficient.

The website size is hovering around 17mb because of the large images, it's atrocious. It's likely why parallax sites keep their images much more simple and limited.

About me section should be listed under the home page, which means I'll have to adjust the size for our mobile and smaller desktop resolutions.
